# DAA
This repository is dedicated to practicing and documenting Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) through Java programming. The goal is to create a structured collection of solutions that demonstrate key algorithmic techniques, problem-solving approaches, and performance analysis.
The repository contains a variety of algorithm implementations and questions, covering fundamental and advanced concepts from DAA. Each program is written in Java with clear structure and readability, making it accessible for students, beginners, and professionals preparing for exams, assignments, or coding interviews.

Some of the important areas included are:

Sorting and Searching algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, etc.)

Divide and Conquer techniques

Greedy algorithms

Dynamic Programming

Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, shortest paths, spanning trees, etc.)

String and combinatorial problems

Each solution is carefully designed to focus not just on correctness but also on time and space complexity analysis, which lies at the core of DAA. The repository will continue to grow with more problems and algorithmic patterns, making it a valuable resource for learners.

ðŸ”‘ Highlights of this repository:

Collection of DAA questions and solutions in Java.

Covers multiple algorithmic paradigms.

Beginner-friendly code with clarity and efficiency.

Useful for academic learning, practice, and technical interviews.

Continuously updated with new problems.

In essence, this repository serves as a knowledge hub for Design and Analysis of Algorithms in Java, designed to support systematic learning and problem-solving practice. Whether you are revising concepts, preparing for an exam, or simply strengthening your algorithmic thinking, this repo provides a reliable and well-structured resource.
